# PipeSim
: Simulate a simple pipelined machine. The design will include writing a detailed simulation program (written in C) which simulates the MIPS architecture, cycle by cycle. The simulator must be cycle-accurate with respect to register contents, i.e., at the end of each simulated clock cycle, the simulated registers should have the same contents as the actual machine would.
